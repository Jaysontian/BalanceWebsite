		<h1>Fundamentals of Balance</h1>
<p>Jayson Tian</p>
<br><br>

<p>According to studies, accidental falls are one of the most common causes of injury or death among the elderly (Tinetti et al., 1998). Falls are caused by balance impairments, which will be the focus of this article. Why are falls more commonly seen in seniors than in people who are younger? Is there a scientific explanation behind this? Studying balance in a biomechanical perspective is highlighted in the health fields. Insight into this process can allow for certain prevention or treatment methods that have not been known of before. Hence, the question arises: What role does aging play at a biomechanics perspective in balance? How can scientists harness this information and develop solutions or prevention measures in terms of health and performance?</p>

<h2>Biomechanics Behind Balance</h2>

<p>Balance exists due to forces. Scientifically defined, forces are interactions that can change the movement of an object. Air resistance, tension, and applied forces are some examples. In everyday life, individuals interact with a variety of forces, such as wind, a push, or even when running. In order to prevent falling or injury, the human body uses a variety of biomechanical processes to maintain and assert control to counteract these forces.</p>

<p>The process can be separated into three steps: stimuli, signal, and response. In the first stage, the body uses numerous receptors to sense external forces interacting with our body. The force is defined as a stimuli, biologically defined as any element that elicits a response in our body. Then, electrical signals are sent through the nervous system to certain body parts, which then results in a response. Dealing with kinematics, certain body movements are performed to counteract the force to prevent the body from falling and injuring oneself.</p>

<h2>The Sixth Sense</h2>

<p>Proprioception is often referred to as the body’s ‘sixth sense’. It is the ability of the body to detect position, self-movement, and maintain equilibrium and balance. (Physiopedia, 2020) This sensor connects with other senses to determine positions of objects relative to the body. The somatosensory and vestibular system in addition to mechanoreceptors on the skin, muscle, and joints combine to generate a signal from the external force through the spinocerebellar tracts targeting the cerebellum, a part of the brain that controls movement. It is important to know that all the receptors are part of the peripheral nervous system (PNS). (Wolff &amp; Shepard, 2013)</p>

		<figcaption>Proprioception can be interpreted as an input output system. A variety of senses detect stimuli, which in this case, are the external forces that act on our body. For example, like wind blowing on us.</figcaption>

</div>
<p>As the signal is passed to the cerebellum, which is part of the central nervous system (CNS), the brain fires a rapid response to other body parts and sensory systems to counteract the force. For example, if a skier is off balance, the brain will attempt to fire responses to the upper body to direct the center of gravity in opposite direction (internal) of the external force. Signals to the legs will tense and shift closer to the displaced center of gravity, and photoelectric sensors will be activated to sense position in relation to surroundings.</p>

<h2>The Signal Carriers</h2>

<p>These signals are fired from the brain and target specific muscles and cells through neurons in the nervous tissue, which relay signals (Visible Body, 2020).</p>

<p>The human body is electrically neutral, however certain membranes separate the positive and negative charges to create electrical potential. Voltage is the measure of potential energy generated by separated charges (Marieb &amp; Hoehn, 2012). The voltage is referred to as the membrane potential biologically. Current also exists within the body, where there is a flow of electricity from one point to another. The resting membrane potential of a neuron is -70 millivolts. The brain releases a proprioceptive signal in response and through the establishment of electrochemical gradients within a neuron by the sodium potassium pump, neurons become polarized and depolarized, passing a current towards the target location. The video below explains this in more detail. In terms of energetics, numerous intermembrane ion and voltage gated channels are active transporters, meaning the requirement of adenosine-triphosphate (ATP) to pump molecules to the other side. The hydrolysis of ATP into phosphate and ADP releases energy for the pump to use. </p>

<h2>From a Physical Standpoint</h2>

<p>When the signal reaches certain muscle groups, sensory systems, and other body parts, the body responds to counteract the force. A more physical definition of balance would be an individual’s ability to keep a constant line of gravity in relation to the base of support, while minimizing postural sway. The equilibrium between mobility and stability results in balance, where stability is the ability to resistant changes to movement and mobility is the ability to facilitate movement. In order to control the body, one needs to asses where the goal of the movement is on the stability-mobility continuum. Two essential factors that contribute to this is the base of support and center of gravity.</p>

<p>The base of support is a 2-D area created by certain support body parts. The ankle and feet are essential parts of this support. A larger base increases stability as more weight is distributed in a greater amount of space (Knudson, 2002). When looking at the center of gravity in relation to the base of support, stability increases the closer it gets. With a center of gravity outside of the base of support, the person will become unstable and fall. Finally, it is also important to note that forces of inertia and friction between the base of support and surface can act as indirect factors in affecting the balance of an object.</p>

<p>Torque is the rotating effect of a force (Knudson, 2002). It is a vector quantity that can be calculated if the variables of product force and moment arm is given. The moment arm is also called the leverage, and it is the perpendicular displacement of the axis of rotation and the movement of the force. The reaction force causing the torque and the moment arm are proportionally related to the torque, and both are equally important.</p>

<p>The human body takes these element into account when recovering from a sudden external force and will attempt to move the center of gravity back within the base of support. </p>

<h2>Application to Aging</h2>

<p>When investigating the decrease of balance through aging, the 3 stages of the process of balance can be tested with various methods. In the first stage, a study can be done to collect quantitative data between reaction of the same force between high school students and seniors. Testing how effectively the body detects certain forces is an effective way of study the effects of aging on proprioception and related sensory systems. Many similar studies have been done, such as looking at joint proprioception impairment in the elderly (Ribeiro &amp; Oliveira, 2007). Next, taking a look at the response of the brain and the efficiency of neurons to be able to carry a response signal, scientists can measure currents, charge, and signal speed of the nervous system in the body when responding to a force. An insulation coat of the neuron called a myelin sheath allows for more efficient conduction of nerve impulses (Bailey, 2018). A study was done on the signal processing stage of balance and discovered the slowing of cognitive processing speed due to age. Biologically, it was found that myelin breakdown was associated with aging (Lu et al., 2011). Physically, muscle joints weaken through aging, suggested by numerous studies. One study investigated certain mechanical characteristics effected on ankle joint muscles during plantar and dorsiflexion through recording the isometric voluntary torques expressed with young and elderly men. </p>

<p>These investigations are significant as they allow for more insight on how such deterioration of a variety of body systems effect balance and develop prevention measures. For example, the aforementioned joint proprioception study collected data that showed the significant positive impact of physical activity and balance training on preventing proprioception impairment (Radak, 2018). Understanding the biomechanics behind these processes have implications for health and the investigation of both cognitive and physical changes associated with aging. An example would be how scientists use this information to find ways to slow age-related balance impairments. A study investigated the benefits of strength training, specifically, unstable surface training. Proprioception is essential in the prevention of fall related injuries (Verhagen et al., 2004). A study demonstrated improvement in ankle and knee stability after a six-week vibration and wobble board training (Cloak et al., 2013). The study utilized measurements of the absolute center of mass to observe weight distribution.</p>

<p>Using biomechanics and understanding of body motions certainly have benefits in solving health and performance related issues, however there are both benefits and downsides in focusing on body movement. The benefit of understanding biomechanics is that the physical process and movement patterns can be better understood, specifically in a health setting. Understanding center of mass and distribution allows for a physician to know which side a cane should be held in relation to an injured leg in rehabilitation. However, health contains a crossing of many interdisciplinary fields. Understanding a situation in just the perspective of biomechanics can be problematic. Balance is a combination of both biomechanics, physics, neurology, and psychology. A variety of body systems and external factors influence this body motion. Hence, it is important to also understand the other processes that are variables of this motion. To conclude, studying the biomechanics and motion behind a body movement allows for solutions to be designed and have implications in the mechanical and physiological state of an individual’s health, however, one must be mindful of other biological, chemical, and psychological factors that also play a role in maintaining balance. Focusing on a unilateral cause can lead to poor understanding and solutions.</p>
